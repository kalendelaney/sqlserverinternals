# SQL Server training from an expert

Kalen Delaney teaches the most advanced SQL Server courses in the world. Her 5-day course “SQL Server Internals and Tuning” is designed for advanced SQL Server professionals who want to know how SQL Server really works, in order to take maximum advantage of its potential.

Kalen has been working with SQL Server for over 30 years. She began her SQL Server journey when she joined the Sybase Corporation in Berkeley, California, in 1987, after earning a Masters Degree in Computer Science and teaching at Berkeley for 6 years. At Sybase, Kalen worked in technical support for two years and then transferred to the training department, where she taught the entire suite of Sybase courses for four years. Her favorite was "Performance, Tuning and Optimization".

Kalen moved with her family to the Beautiful Pacific Northwest in 1992 and  began a very rewarding relationship with Microsoft. She has written courseware and delivered internal training for Microsoft as well as providing consulting and training services to individuals and companies around the world.  In 1996, she took over the writing of the Inside SQL Server book from its original author, Ron Soukup, and published in-depth books on SQL Server Internals and Tuning for versions 7, 2000. 2005, 2008 and 2012. 

Kalen was also on the original planning committee for both SQL Server Magazine and the original PASS (Professional Organization for SQL Server) conference in 1999.
